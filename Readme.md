# Mind Map Notes to the 12 Hour Course by Bob Ziroll

## Why React?
- Composable - Different components can be used all along the project
- Declarative - Tell the program what to do and it will take care by itself. Relying on react to append the components to DOM.

- Syntax JSX - JavaScript XML, Looks like HTML. It made react really declarative. Some differences are their like, instead of using class, we use className. It's creating POJO(Plain old javascript objects) in the behind. JSX can be thoughts as a function which return javascript objects that react can interpret and use to create actual elements.\n
With JSX, only return **one parent element**.
